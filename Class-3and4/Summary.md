# Class 3 and 4

I started the class with Dave Ceddia's tutorial by creating a react app by
`npx create-react-app daveceddia-tut-sf`

Initially got a lot of problem because the `npm start` command was giving a handling error.  
Tried to work it out by installing react-scripts globally, then downgrading react-scripts, but nothing worked. Even the react app example that i created for class 2 wasn't starting.  
Then, simply restarted the machine, and it started working.  

Played around with the dave ceddia tutorial.
